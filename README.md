# Swagger Function App

A simple starting point for Function apps that has a Swagger interface.

This was built with the help of **Justin Yoo** - and his [AzureFunctions.Extensions](https://github.com/aliencube/AzureFunctions.Extensions) 

Thanks!

## Getting Started

### Installing
Fork or clone this bad boy and run it up. 

This is nothing more than a simple Function App that will return what ever variable you throw at in as a url parameter.

### Using
To navigate to the Swagger Ui use

```
http://localhost:7071/api/swagger/ui
```

## Deployment
